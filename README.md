# Machine Learning Notebooks

This repository contains **Jupyter notebooks demonstrating machine learning experiments** on different datasets. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning for various ML models.

Notebooks included in this repository:

| Dataset / Project | Notebook | Description |
|------------------|---------|-------------|
| Hospital Length of Stay | [`hospital_length_stay_prediction.ipynb`](https://github.com/MohSalamh/ML-Notebooks/blob/main/hospital_length_stay_prediction.ipynb) | Predict patient length of stay using Linear, Lasso and Ridge regression models with polynomial features and applying Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV |
|Portuguese banking Marketing | [`bank_marketing_predict_client_response.ipynb`](https://github.com/MohSalamh/ML-Notebooks/blob/main/bank_marketing_predict_client_response.ipynb) | Predict whether a client will subscribe to a bank term deposit using Logistic Regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN) (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest models, and apply GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters |
| EMNIST Handwritten Letters | [`clustering_handwritten_letters.ipynb`](https://github.com/MohSalamh/ML-Notebooks/blob/main/clustering_handwritten_letters.ipynb) | Apply unsupervised learning techniques to cluster handwritten letter images based on visual similarity using K-Means clustering, including data preprocessing, feature extraction from image pixels, and visualisation of cluster assignments to explore patterns in handwritten characters |
