# Machine Learning Notebooks

This repository contains **Jupyter notebooks demonstrating machine learning experiments** on different datasets. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning for various ML models.

Notebooks included in this repository:

| Dataset / Project | Notebook | Description |
|------------------|---------|-------------|
| Hospital Length of Stay | `hospital_length_stay_prediction.ipynb` | Predict patient length of stay using Linear, Lasso and Ridge regression models with polynomial features and applying Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV |
|Portuguese banking Marketing | `bank_marketing_predict_client_response.ipynb` | Predict whether a client will subscribe to a bank term deposit using Logistic Regression, -nearest neighbors (KNN) (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest models, and apply GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters |
